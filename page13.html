            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-10"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior High School is like a tremor for me. It’s like my perspective in studies was shaken and I was put into another realm where your number one enemy is yourself. You will see yourself bombarded with so many questions like “kaya ko pa ba kaya ito?” or “matutulog pa ba ako?” In the first weeks, I was completely flabbergasted by the tons of work to do already and this led me to the part where pressure and stress lies. The reason is because I can’t manage my time rightly to do it. So, my conclusion is to try following the strategies that are said in the English for Academic and Professional Purposes (EAPP) book which is to “Study smarter, not harder”. It’s because you really need to control yourself on how to handle your time wisely and efficiently and always remember to avoid procrastination, but again, it’s easier said (or read) than to be done. For the first time in my high school life, I experienced going to school with only 2-3 hours of sleep for a straight week. My head is aching so badly and my chest feels so heavy. I was so stressed that I can barely breathe, which brings to me another level of stress wherein I began to cry every night, and be irritable. Maybe this is also the main reason why my concentration was affected.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anxiety, Edginess, and trepidation filled my system because midterm examination is already right next door, which is way more intense than what I felt during the other weeks. I am still not yet prepared, but there is no room for dilly dallying, right? Together with my close friends, we decided to study as a group by the 13th of October which is three days ahead before the said examination. We mainly focused on the field of General Chemistry by mastering the past quizzes that was given, thinking that it is somehow similar but we were mistaken. We were definitely, absolutely, and certainly erroneous of what we visualized it could be.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midterms were like a trial that will assess my capability to handle tension or the pressure. Can I endure the feeling of having low results or will I give my best shot on this examination despite of the difficulty to focus? I can say, it was challenging but I chose to give it all. No matter what happens, I will still give my best shot on it. It’s because, I may feel drained but nevertheless my parents are way more tired and stressed out but they never give up.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anxiety does love me, though. Even if I’ve got the motivation…the inspiration, edginess is still evident in me on those three consecutive days. My parents can’t even talk to me properly because I was so grouchy on everything. I also think that, maybe because since then, I was so anxious of the aftermaths of all the subjects that it piled up in my mind like a stack-o. What if I managed my time wisely and do a two-hour study per subject every day since the beginning, would I still be this hassled and pressured?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum it up all, midterm examination tested me and my capabilities. How long can I stomach stress? What are the ways on how to prevent or lessen the pressure of the deadlines? How can I prevent myself on being always on edge? It also awoke me to be much more motivated.  I believe, even if it is so hard, if you are really determined to pass it all, you will and can do it. That reminds me of the American actress, Lauren Bacall’s line “You don’t always win your battles, but it’s good to know you fought.”</p></div>
