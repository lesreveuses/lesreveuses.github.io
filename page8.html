            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-10"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Paris could've greeted the year 1890 pleasantly if not for the occurrence of a horrifying tragedy on the 31st of December. It was at the <em>Palais Garnier</em> that the misfortune befell. Two notable stars from the opera house were slain at a New Year's Eve Masquerade that was held at the Palais Garnier. Every guest was enjoying the gaiety gala that unfortunate night. Nothing peculiar transpired at the masquerade that could have incited any signs of danger,  and so none of the guests, and even the staff of the opera house expected for a crime to happen at that very event.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; On the first day of 1890, still, no one knew. It took three days after the gala for the people to see the two principal dancers' bodies. Everyone in the opera house ransacked every corner of the premises, which did not take too long as they have found two corpses from two not-very-hard-to-find rooms; the first body at her private dressing room and the second one was inside box three (which was seldom used as it was being prepared for repair). The way the two ballerinas were murdered was identical. Both girls have lassos around their reddish necks, implying that they were murdered by suffocation. The question of every worker and performers of Palais Garnier is: Who did it?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The other ballerinas' have their suspicion of the suspect. All were saying the same name: <strong>Etienne Bossuet</strong>. Even stagehands agreed (for the reason that they simply don't care and they would rather drink their flasks of rum in their posts than to participate in the interrogations). Even Madame Rosseau, the ballet instructor, nodded to the ballerinas' assumption without plausible evidence. The managers, for the sake of immediately leaving the case behind and to maintain the opera house's clean sheet of reputation, pushed Etienne Bossuet as the accused. Their accusation of Etienne became more reasonable when he left after the day they found the two ladies' bodies. His retreat insinuated that he might be guilty of doing the crime that's why he left the country for Romania. But is it enough to consider him as a suspect? Why was everyone accusing Etienne? But firstly, what actually happened that led to this horrendous murder?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It started when a new talent arrived in Paris in 1888. <strong>Margaux Vaugrenard</strong> was a French girl who had spent her childhood in Marseille. Margaux left her lavish life behind and traveled a long way to Paris with one goal in mind, to be a well-known performer. But she had not planned well, and she found herself lost in the streets of Paris. She was too determined (foolish, even) and engulfed in her ambitions that she forgot to think things through beforehand. Margaux, being a foreigner to the city, went straight to the only place she knew, and she always dreamt she'd go: <em>La Palais Garnier</em>. She went inside the intricately built edifice of the opera house, in hopes that she would pursue her ambition in that place. As expected, Madame Rosseau, a middle-aged ballet instructor, and a box keeper offered her to be one of the chorus dancers first because apparently, it is impossible for a newcomer to barge in the opera house and claim the title of a principal dancer.  There was no turning back for Margaux at that time, she couldn't just run miles back to Marseille just because she thought that there was no chance of pursuing her goals, after all, attainment of success is not immediate. So she accepted Madame Rosseau's offer and worked hard even if she had to bend and break her ankles from dancing too hard.</p><p><br></p></div>

        <div class="media-container-row">
            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-10"><p>&nbsp;In the first week of her stay, she made several friends. First was a girl with light-colored locks that every Parisian woman dreamt to have. Her name was <em>Caroline Micheaux</em>. At first look, Margaux actually thought that Caroline was quite snooty and was not interested to befriend her. But when they conversed, she found that the girl was actually well-intentioned but bipolar (which Margaux had easily observed in just a few days). Fortunately, Margaux’s new friend taught her everything she needed to know because as Caroline had told her, Palais Garnier has a very complicated environment and it is quite hard to get used to at first. Caroline even taught her the <em>cancan</em> as it has been a famous dance due to it being usually seen performed in places like the  <em>Moulin Rouge</em>, a cabaret known for the said dance.</p><p>&nbsp;Margaux met the other dancers, some she had grown fond with: Románe, the girl with eccentric purple eyes, Marcelle, who was formerly a cabaret dancer, and Clemence, who was fond of singing more than her actual job. Margaux had been acquainted with every performer and even stagehands. All except the principal dancer of the opera, <strong>Estelle de Vaugne</strong>. She was the 'best', the leading lady at every production that they performed. She's foul, they said and Margaux never wished of meeting nor being acquainted with the woman.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; One day, the whole opera was rehearsing a play that they were about to perform for that night. The production of <em>"La Versailles"</em>, requires heavy, big gowns and tall wigs for both females and males. Since they were doing a dress rehearsal, everyone had their costumes on. The ladies kept on fussing about the weight of their tutus and their hairpieces. Clemence was even worried about doing her turns wearing her ridiculously heavy tutu and embarrassing herself in front of the upper-class Parisians by falling onto her face. Boys have the same predicament as the ladies. But what could they say? A big production would bring a lot of money. Meanwhile, Estelle was quite satisfied with her costume, with it bearing most of the beautiful colors and materials. She posed smugly at first position, waiting for Monsieur Fournier's (the chorus master) signal to the orchestra. She was playing <em>Madame Marie-Claire</em>, who was, apparently, the lead character. Estelle, Monsieur Fournier, and the orchestra were rehearsing the first part for the first act. It was a solo, and it was nothing special as it does not contain hard choreography because it was simply an introduction. The hardest part would be in Act 3, which is also a solo but requires flawlessly done 30 <em>fouettés</em>. At this part, everyone that portrays Marie-Claire was required to change into a special pair of pointe shoes. Being the lead part always had the honor to have several pairs of shiny new pointe shoes.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The corps de ballet chose to stay inside the studio to converse with each other since they weren't needed for Act 2. Margaux had been talking to Caroline and Románe. The topics of their conversations were random as time passed by until they decided to focus on a certain person, Estelle.</p><p>&nbsp;"Estelle was nice before she was the prima ballerina. But she seems like a completely different person now" Románe said with her small voice.  Caroline let out an unladylike snort as she brushed her yellowish hair. "Right you are. But she has been awful right from the start. Terrible friend, really. I can't believe I once called her my best friend. It makes me want to vomit. I wish she'd be sent off the opera house, and just be one of the whores in Moulin Rouge. That would suit her."</p><p>Caroline immediately glanced at a fellow ballerina sitting quietly across her. "No offense, Marcelle."</p><p>"She was your best friend?" Margaux asked, a shocked expression on her face.</p><p>"Unfortunately," Caroline bluntly confirmed. "But if I have the chance, I would push the girl to the <em>Seine.</em>"</p><p>"Isn't that too harsh? She has been your friend in the first place. Surely, you wouldn't do that right?"&nbsp;</p><p>Caroline chuckled and put her wooden brush down."Margaux, <em>ma chérie</em>, do you actually thought I could do that?<em> S'il vous plaît</em>, don't take all I say too seriously. I am merely joking."</p><p>"She's right. She doesn't really mean anything she says. Micheaux's humor is solely as dark as the slums of Saint Michel. You will soon get used to it," Clemence remarked. Caroline wore a grin as she hurriedly excused herself.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The conversation went on until it reached the time where other dancers have joined. The ladies were dancing the cancan to humor themselves. Marcelle was impressed with Margaux and jokingly commented that Margaux could make a good cabaret dancer. After that, some ballerinas attempted fouettés that led to a competition of who could do the most fouettés. Románe did a perfect 10, beautifully executed but not much. Clemence did a 5, which was the least. Marcelle, a good 15, Caroline, a 29,  and to everyone's surprise, Margaux executed a perfect 32. The light-haired girl was as red as a tomato.</p><p>"<em>Magnifique</em>!" A girl exclaimed.&nbsp;</p><p>"That was amazing!"</p><p>"You almost got to a 35. Excellent job Vaurgrenard!" Marcelle complimented.</p><p>"I didn't know ladies from Marseille could do that," a male voice interrupted. It was Etienne's. Etienne Bossuet was also a principal dancer. He was a handsome man with distinct facial features. He has long golden, curly locks that he took pride in. He could be self-important at times. He was the type of spoiled boy who gets everything that he wants.&nbsp;</p><p>"Ah, Etienne, what brings you here?" Caroline, and who also known of having a liking towards Etienne, asked.</p><p>"Mademoiselle Vaugrenard brought me here. I'm quite pleased about the way she dances, I’d say, even better than Estelle's." Etienne said, however, Margaux ignored it. She noticed a glint of jealousy in Caroline's eyes. She did everything she could to make a straight face as she felt intimidated by her stare.</p><p>"Margaux, you would make a great Madame Marie-Claire," said Clemence. "You have a better technique than Estelle. Maybe you could replace her."</p><p>"Definitely not," Caroline said it all in full seriousness. Micheaux swore bitterly under her breath, “<em>salope</em>.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Night came and the performance had begun. All seats and boxes were occupied. It was in the middle of Act 3, the hard part, when Estelle as Madame Marie-Claire was putting her pointe shoes on when she noticed how uncomfortable they felt. She was in the first position as she prepared herself for the 30 <em>fouettés</em>. She attempted the first <em>fouetté</em>, but when she was finally on the tips of her toes, she let out a loud painful cry and fell. Whispers and murmurs filled the opera. The ballerinas were curious so they ran at the side of the stage to watch. Estelle was pale, besides all the thick makeup on her face. She was crying in pain while frantically untying the pointe shoes off her feet. She felt like she would not be able to walk or stand either.  Audiences were dumbfounded and some were yelling negative remarks. The managers did all their best to calm them down. Estelle took off the shoes and saw how bloody her feet were.</p><p><br></p></div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-10"><p>"She's bleeding!" A dancer yelled. Etienne and a male dancer carried the bleeding girl off the stage.</p><p>“How did this happen?” Madame Rosseau exclaimed.</p><p>“Someone did something to my shoes!” Estelle screamed. She scanned the crowd of people that surrounded her bearing mixed expressions on their faces. Estelle’s glare bore at the red-haired ballerina clutching Caroline’s arm.</p><p>&nbsp;“It was you, wasn’t it?” Estelle de Vaugne pointed accusingly. “You, the new girl! I heard what Clemence said. You wanted to replace me!”&nbsp;</p><p>Clemence defended herself, “I have said nothing like that.”</p><p>“Don’t you dare accuse her, de Vaugne! Madame Rosseau, you know Margaux cannot do that.” Caroline defended Margaux, who has been silent due to shock. “She has been with us the whole time.”</p><p>“Perhaps it was you, Micheaux,” Estelle transferred the accusation to Caroline. “You’re an insufferable jealous rat-”</p><p>“Madame I think it’s time for you to rest.” The manager cut the tension backstage. “Somebody bring Madame de Vaugne to the infirmary.”</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;The managers didn't know how to fix the mess that occurred in their big production. They needed someone to fill in the lead role as soon as possible, now that some of the guests were starting to leave.</p><p>"Now that somebody had mentioned it, maybe Margaux could be Marie-Claire tonight," Marcelle caught the attention of both Madame Rosseau and the managers. "Margaux can do it. We all saw."</p><p>"A chorus girl, you say?" Asked one of the managers incredulously.</p><p>"Believe us, Monsieur. Besides, there’s nothing more that we can do," All the ballerinas agreed, including Etienne Bossuet. Margaux kept silent, but deep inside, she felt anxious and excited. She really wanted to portray Madame Marie-Claire.The managers agreed considering that they have no choice and that the show must go on. So they decided to perform Act 2 first so Margaux could prepare and change outfits, but this time, they use a new pair of special pointe shoes. And then to repeat Act 1 but with Margaux as the lead this time. They executed the whole production exceptionally well that night.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; A day after, positive reviews and comments were written in every newspaper about Margaux Vaugrenard’s performance. Everyone was impressed by the new principal dancer. Indeed, Margaux was promoted that night. The public was asking, Is Margaux Vaugrenard going to replace the star, Estelle de Vaugne? And due to public demand, the managers insisted Margaux do every lead in the next productions to come. Margaux agreed immediately as she felt like the attainment of her dreams were just on the tip of her fingers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Indeed, Margaux pursued her ambition to be a famous performer in Paris. She was always the lead at every production and she got all the glory. Her schedule was filled with rehearsals and she was never seen conversing with her friends anymore. Free time was not available for her situation at that moment. If she did have the chance, she talked to them for a minute then she'll suddenly excuse herself due to Madame Rosseau calling her for rehearsal. Caroline had been ignoring her since 'La Versailles', that left Margaux to spend the rest of her minimal extra time with Romane. As for Estelle, she still returned to the opera, still a principal dancer but not getting much bigger roles. It caused the ballerinas to freely taunt her but Estelle just kept reserved, which was quite strange.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Months passed until it became a year, Margaux's name was still on the tabloids and newspapers. Caroline eventually stopped ignoring her, but it never came back to start when they were comfortable chatting with each other. She was usually seen sitting alone and sometimes she was scribbling something in a piece of parchment. They thought that pieces of parchment were parts of her diary because she always put those parchments under her pillow before she sleeps.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Meanwhile, Etienne had been doing his best to catch Margaux's attention. Everyone in the opera house already knew of the feelings he had developed to the new Prima Ballerina. But the gestures that he did around her as hints were subtle for Margaux.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The time had come when Etienne decided to say everything he wanted to say to Margaux. And it was the day before the New Year's Eve celebration. It was that morning when he told her, and her response was what he least expected. The girl rejected him. Never in his whole life had he been rejected. He was furious. And her reason wasn't too acceptable for Etienne. She told him that she had no time for love, and she only see him as a friend.&nbsp;</p><p>The news about the rejection spread in the opera house like wildfire. And the people knew how mad Etienne was. A ballerina even heard him say to his friend, "she'll regret what she did. She shouldn't have rejected me. She'll never know what's coming for her, and she surely won't like it. That salope."&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The ballerina told her friends until all the chorus dancers knew about it.  While the ballet dancers were busy talking inside the dormitories, Caroline walked in with a box in hand.</p><p>"What's inside that Caroline?" Jammes asked.</p><p>"It's just a .. package from someone. I have no idea what's inside," answered Caroline. She put the sealed box under her cot.&nbsp;</p><p>"Come on, let us see," squealed Clemence. “Is it from a lover?”</p><p>"No, no. The letter says I shall be the one who could only see it." Caroline replied and chuckled. The girls could tell that she was lying but they did not push it further, maybe it just contains her costume and mask for the masquerade later that night.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The night of the New Year's Eve Masquerade came. All were dressed in their best costumes and beautifully decorated masks. The opera house was beautifully decorated. It was such a marvelous way to welcome a new year. Everyone was in the lobby of the opera house, except for two ladies: Margaux Vaugrenard and Estelle de Vaugne.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Margaux was inside her dressing room, preparing herself for the gala. A creaking sound made her halt from combing her red hair, then she looked around the room. By the door stood a cloaked figure with a plain black mask that covered the person's whole face. At first, Margaux thought it was Romane.</p><p>"You told me you're going to wear peach so we would match. Why is it that you're wearing all black?" Asked Margaux. The person didn't reply. It entered the room and closed the door behind. The stranger revealed a lasso from its cloak.&nbsp;</p><p>"Etienne? What are you doing with that?"</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;It came closer to her and Margaux never got the chance to scream, for the stranger quickly put the lasso around her neck and tightened its knot. She couldn't breathe, she was whispering her plead. Minutes after, Margaux Vaugrenard was put to peace.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Estelle was in no mood to join the party. Masquerade galas were her thing before her fame and reputation came crumbling down. She reached the boxes and settled in box three. She reminisced the time when she got all the fame. Indeed she was happy but never contented. It always felt like she's missing something. Oh yes, she had lost her friends. Caroline started to ignore her after she became a principal dancer. They shared the same dream, and it was Estelle who achieved it. Because of that, Caroline felt betrayed, even though it wasn't Estelle's fault to be chosen. And since then, Estelle told herself that she needed no friends to complete her when she got all she wanted the glory, the attention, but they too are gone.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Footsteps stopped her train of thoughts. She was not alone. A rope passed by her view and she felt it being wrapped on her neck. It was tightened and it stayed like that until she stopped breathing. Estelle de Vaugne died.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;No one knew about the cloaked person with the plain black mask, considering there were no witnesses. It was only Margaux who saw it, and she's dead. The only evidence found was the two lassos. And so they left the case with Etienne Bossuet as the suspect. A ballerina told the authorities about the threat that she heard Etienne once said:</p><p>"She'll regret what she did. She shouldn't have rejected me. She'll never know what's coming for her, and she surely won't like it."</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; And it was an acceptable evidence. Everyone in the opera thought that because of the rejection, it caused Etienne to kill Margaux instead if he couldn't have her. But there was no reason to kill Estelle de Vaugne. The two even barely talked to each other.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; But that was how the case was closed. Authorities managed to contact the officials of Romania to arrest the French boy. And he was sentenced imprisonment for thirty years.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Months after, the opera house went back to normal. The original managers retired and was replaced by a new 'fair' one. Madame Rosseau was still the Ballet Instructor. Romane became one of the principal dancers. Clemence became depressed.  And Caroline Micheaux left the opera house to get back to her hometown.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Just after she left Paris, Romane found something under her bed.</p><p>"Oh my, girls! I think Caroline left something," Monique called out. The girls crowded around her. It was that 'package' that she kept just before the Masquerade. Its seal was broken so Monique removed its cover.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; At the top was a plain black mask, and a dark cloak neatly folded under. She pulled it all out. "What are those for?" Asked Jammes.</p><p>"<em>Je ne sais pas</em>."</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; And there were piles of parchment inside the box. They were the pieces for Caroline's diary. At the top of the pile must be the last one written. It was written:</p><p><em><strong>1889, December 31,</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>la mort est pour ceux qui ont volé mes rêves</strong></em></p><p><em>(death is for those who stole my dreams).</em></p><p><br></p></div>
