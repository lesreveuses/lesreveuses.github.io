            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-10"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just for a mere affection, people would sacrifice things in order to be connected. A high relatable composition, The Flight from Conversation by Shelly Turkle would absolutely explain how unattainable things would be already possible and reachable within just one click.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This work of Turkle caught me in awe and made me realize how the innovation changes us. The generation that the world has at this moment wouldn’t know the feeling of playing outdoor Filipino kid games. They wouldn’t be aware of the fact that socializing with other kids would be much more fun since they focus with those tiny devices. Those gadgets had become their companion all throughout the day. It gave them a new kind of world where they can change, fake, or even undo things that they don’t think suits their profile. Their unattainable dream for themselves was made possible with just one click.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Precisely, this composition would generalize and describe how the invention of those intelligent gadgets would influence the people on their everyday lives. Teens right now would definitely choose to stay at home and socialize with their internet friends than to go out and hang out with their family. They would also choose to play on the games that are installed on their phone than to play outdoor activities with other people. Kids or teens focus more on enhancing skills in games than to enhance their abilities and talents in sports.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those people who became slaves to those devices include me. Social interaction with long distant people welcomed me and as well, changed me. When I use my phone, I feel like I enter a new world. At first, this world welcomed me and offered me an opportunity to change and portray my inner self that made me loved it. I loved the feeling how they cared, how they supported me, and even listened to me when no one does but the happiness that I felt had its charge.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I watched them how they easily talked to others as they slowly leave me. I watched them forget and became a stranger in a snap. This setup made me stressed that my real-world friends are already affected and that made me conclude that every happiness has its own cost. I had so many internet friends but only two people stayed by my side up until now. The laughter that they gave me left me broken.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly Turkle, made me realize that everything has its own boundary. Social friends aren’t permanent for also in just one click, anyone could leave. You shouldn’t fake yourself just for a mere affection. You should only just focus on the people who accepted you wholly and completely for who you are since then. Having internet friends are not bad and dangerous, but if you exceeded and focused or devoted yourself into it maybe there’s already a problem within it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Flight from Conversation by Shelly Turkle brought me a confirmation to just stop, look to at the people around you and listen as they start the conversation.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p></div>
