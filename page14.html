This movie talks about the journey of the three guardians of the afterlife and a man who died as a paragon. Along With the Gods, will hook one and will bring he or she to tears as the characters of the flick voyage in the afterlife.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kim Ja Ho, a firefighter, dies after saving a little girl from a scorching lofty building. He was welcomed by three individuals who introduced themselves as the guardians of the afterlife, saying that they will be the ones who will be defending him as his trial goes on and uphold that he truly deserves a reincarnation. This prosecution of the paragon, Jang Ho, will reveal all the good things and the worst incidents that he made or happened in his life. He will be adjudicated in many trials such as in deceit, indolence, injustice, betrayal, violence, murder, and filial impiety.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the best scenes in this movie that one would surely appreciate and enjoy would be the scene before the main ending. In this said scene, Su Hong, Ja Ho’s brother, visited the dream of their terminally ill mother and showed up wearing a prosecutor’s uniform. He talked to her beloved mother and brought back the occurrence that happened long-long time ago that was never given a chance to be considered about when his two sons are still alive and breathing. The eyes of Su Hong were full of tears when he asked for forgiveness for what he and his brother did way back. The mother, who was terminally ill, voiced out for the first time, that she was remorseful for she was the real reason on why their lives went miserable in the first place.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The casts of this movie truly displayed that they are worth it for their character. Any individual who would be watching this would be definitely touched by their lines and performances.  For example of the casts are Ye Soo-Jung and Ha Jung-woo. Ye Soo-Jung, acting as Ja Hong’s mother, indeed expressed her part accordingly and always stayed in character.  She managed herself not to speak during her scenes and learned the way how to dialect through other ways and gestures. Also, Ha Jung-woo, portraying as Gang-rim, also controlled himself to be serious and his facial expressions all the time. He remained serious-minded leader all throughout the trial and investigation. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This movie would undoubtedly change one’s perspective in life on making decisions and in what way he or she would act and would give consequential impact to everyone.  The special effects of this movie will really give the spectators the same emotions of the characters when they feel the panic and distress that they show through the film. They will likewise bring the viewer into a rollercoaster-like feeling while watching the flick.</p><p><br></p></div>
